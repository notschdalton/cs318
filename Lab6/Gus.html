                     <p>Shawn Spencer happens to possess some uncanny powers of observation thanks to his father, Henry, a former police officer who taught his son to remember even the smallest details of his surroundings. When Shawn is accused of committing a crime that he actually solved, he convinces the cops that he's a psychic -- and with the reluctant help of best friend Gus, Shawn starts solving cases for a skeptical but increasingly impressed police force.</p>
                        <p>Main Characters: Shawn Spencer, Burton Guster, Juliet O'Hara, Carlton Lassiter, Karen VIck, and Henry Spencer</p>

                    <p>On nearly every episode of Psych, Dul√© Hill's Burton "Gus" Guster would receive an embarrassing new nickname courtesy of his best friend and partner, Shawn Spencer (James Roday). It became almost a weekly tradition for Shawn to introduce Gus with a false - but funny - nickname that would usually earn him a frustrated look from Gus. The Psych Gus nicknames are one of the show's highlights for fans, so here's everything to know about SOME of Spencer's nicknames for Gus.</p>
