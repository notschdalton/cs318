                    <h1>THE Pineapple</h1>
                    <p>According to USA Network’s website, there is a pineapple in almost every episode of Psych. Wow, that’s dedication! And it’s probably difficult for fans to always spot the fruit every time. If that’s the case, don’t worry.</p>

                        <p>There’s a website dedicated to spotting the pineapples in every episode of Psych. Of course, many fans have probably spotted all of them already. But if not, there’s always next time. It could be anywhere, so watch carefully.</p>
