                     <h2>Description:</h2>
                     <p>Shawn Spencer happens to possess some uncanny powers of observation thanks to his father, Henry, a former police officer who taught his son to remember even the smallest details of his surroundings. When Shawn is accused of committing a crime that he actually solved, he convinces the cops that he's a psychic -- and with the reluctant help of best friend Gus, Shawn starts solving cases for a skeptical but increasingly impressed police force.</p>
                        <p>Main Characters: Shawn Spencer, Burton Guster, Juliet O'Hara, Carlton Lassiter, Karen VIck, and Henry Spencer</p>
