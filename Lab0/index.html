        <h2>Graphic Communication</h2>
         <p>My dream job would be creating graphics for an nfl team or designing movie posters.</p>
         <h3>Junior</h3>
         <p>I know nothing about coding, so I just hope to learn the basics, pass the class, and find joy in the little things. (Figuring this ALL out lol)</p>
         <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
         <p>My favorite things are hanging out with friends and my girlfriend. I enjoy listening to music, painting, playing some videogames, playing yard games, playing with animals, going to church, and watching shows and movies</p>
